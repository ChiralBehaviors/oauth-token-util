#This is an example config file. Fill in appropriate values for the fields below,
#uncomment the lines, and run the main file with the argument:

#secret: <shhhhhhh don't tell. But from Salesforce, it's a number string about 20 digits long>
#redirectUris are for when you've got a web app doing a handshake with the OAuth server
#if you're not doing that (and we aren't), just fake it. No one cares, and there will not
#be a test. More importantly, no one validates the callback.

#Please note: this is for the Salesforce OAuth password flow, which means, yes, using plaintext
#credentials. The intent is to get a one-time OAuth token for prototyping. THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION
#CODE and it's certainly not a best practice. I recommend using this for developer organizations
#ONLY. Also, for the love of god, don't populate this file and then check it in anywhere. That
#would be bad.
#For API requests, Salesforce typically requires you to concatenate your password with a security
#token, so do that. Search the Salesforce docs for more info
